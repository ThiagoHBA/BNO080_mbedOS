/*
 * This is USC RPL's ARM MBed BNO080 IMU driver, by Jamie Smith.
 *
 * It is based on SparkFun and Nathan Seidle's Arduino driver for this chip, but is substantially rewritten and adapted.
 * It also supports some extra features, such as setting the mounting orientation and
 * enabling some additional data reports.
 *
 * This driver uses no dynamic allocation, but does allocate a couple hundred bytes of class variables as buffers.
 * This should allow you to monitor its memory usage using MBed's size printout.
 *
 * The BNO080 is a very complex chip; it's capable of monitoring and controlling other sensors and making
 * intelligent decisions and calculations using its data.  Accordingly, the protocol for communicating with it
 * is quite complex, and it took me quite a while to wrap my head around it.  If you need to modify or debug
 * this driver, look at the CPP file for an overview of the chip's communication protocol.
 *
 * Note: this driver only supports I2C.  I attempted to create an SPI version, but as far as I can tell,
 * the BNO's SPI interface has a bug that causes you to be unable to wake the chip from sleep in some conditions.
 * Until this is fixed, SPI on it is virtually unusable.
